# Faraday — AGENTS.md

Brand new project (created May 2026). No code yet.

**Goal:** Fullstack app to track content creator KPIs (followers, views, etc.), contact info, and display in a dashboard. Future: marketplace for brand-creator contracts/scouting.

## Key sources of truth

Design/spec docs live in `Faraday/`:
- `High Level Specs.md` — CRM, contract/project manager, and marketplace goals
- `Design Things to Add.md` — reminder list of pending features (dark mode, CSV upload, etc.)
- `project_definition.md` — reserved for a formal definition (currently empty)
- `agent_prompts.md` — prompts for the 7-agent development pipeline
- `tasks.md` (generated inside `Faraday/`) — ordered tasks with success criteria (created by Program Manager agent)
- `Faraday/designs/` — UI/UX design specs (created by UI/UX Designer agent)
- `Faraday/docs/` — wiki-style documentation (created by Documentation agent)

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Django 5.2 + Django REST Framework |
| Frontend | Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS) |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| ORM | Django ORM |
| Containerization | Docker Compose |

## Dev Commands

```bash

## Next.js 16 conventions (breaking changes from prior versions)

Read `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Key differences:

- **`params` and `searchParams` are Promises** — always `await` them in pages, layouts, route handlers. Never access synchronously.
- **`middleware.ts` is deprecated** — use `proxy.ts` at project root instead (export `proxy` function).
- **`GET` route handlers are NOT cached by default** — opt in with `dynamic = 'force-static'` or `use cache`.
- **`<Image preload>` replaces `<Image priority>`** — `priority` is deprecated.
- **`cookies()` and `headers()` must be awaited** — they are async in v16.
- **`PageProps`, `LayoutProps`, `RouteContext`** — globally available type helpers (no import needed) for route param inference.
- **`use cache` directive** — new caching mechanism; works with `cacheLife()` / `cacheTag()` from `next/cache`.
- **`proxy.ts` replaces `middleware.ts`** — `next.config` keys renamed: `skipProxyUrlNormalize`, `skipTrailingSlashRedirect`.

## Filesystem rules

Keep `Faraday/` exclusively for human-readable planning and documentation. Do not add anything to `Faraday/` without asking first — the only exceptions are task files (`tasks.md`), UI/UX design specs (`designs/`), and wiki-style docs (`docs/`). No code, config, or generated artifacts belong there.

## Subagent Workflow (Context Management)

Use the Task tool to spin off agents rather than doing all roles in one context. Each subagent receives only the context it needs.

### Agent → Subagent Mappings

| Pipeline Role | Task `subagent_type` | Context passed in | Returns |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Program Manager** | `general` | High Level Specs.md, Design Things to Add.md, AGENTS.md | Updated `Faraday/tasks.md` |
| **UI/UX Designer** | `general` | Task spec from tasks.md, existing design files, AGENTS.md | Design spec in `Faraday/designs/` |
| **Programmer** | `general` | Task spec, design spec (if UI), relevant source files, AGENTS.md | Code changes, summary |
| **Tester** | `general` | Task spec, modified source files, existing tests | Test results (written to tests files) |
| **Adversarial Reviewer** | `general` | Task spec, code diff, test results, AGENTS.md | Review verdict (PASS/FAIL + issues) |
| **Security Reviewer** | `general` | Task spec, final code, test results | Security verdict |
| **Documentation** | `explore` | Codebase files, task specs, existing docs | Updated `Faraday/docs/` |

### Orchestration Pattern

```
1. ORCHESTRATOR calls PM subagent → receives updated tasks.md
2. If UI task: ORCHESTRATOR calls UI/UX Designer → receives design spec
3. ORCHESTRATOR calls Programmer → receives code + summary
4. ORCHESTRATOR calls Tester → receives test results
5. Loop: if tests fail → ORCHESTRATOR calls Programmer (fix) → Tester (re-run)
6. ORCHESTRATOR calls Adversarial Reviewer → receives verdict
7. If FAIL → ORCHESTRATOR calls Programmer (fix issues)
   → MUST call Reviewer again (re-review on ALL code changes)
   → If still FAIL → repeat loop
8. If PASS → ORCHESTRATOR calls Security Reviewer (if needed)
9. ORCHESTRATOR calls Documentation → receives updated docs
10. ORCHESTRATOR commits and pushes
```

> [!critical] Re-review rule
> After ANY code change — even a single-line import fix — the orchestrator MUST call the Adversarial Reviewer again before proceeding. Do not skip to Security or Documentation. A changed line could introduce a new issue. The only exception is when the Tester's test-only changes (no source code modification) pass.

### Context Budget Rules

- **PM agent:** Keep to High Level Specs + tasks.md only. Don't dump full codebase.
- **UI/UX Designer:** Only needs the task description + visual design notes. No code.
- **Programmer:** Task spec + design spec + relevant source files only. Not the whole codebase.
- **Tester:** Task spec + modified source files + existing tests. Not the full app.
- **Reviewers:** Task spec + diff of changed files + test output. Not full context.
- **Documentation:** Use `explore` agent (has read-only tools) to traverse finished code.

### Todo List Discipline

Always use `todowrite` to track multi-step work. Mark items as they complete. If an agent returns a FAIL verdict, add a follow-up todo and loop.

## Orchestrator Rules (Do Not Write Code)

The orchestrator is the user-facing agent. These rules are absolute:

1. **NEVER write, edit, or delete code directly.** Every code change must go through the Programmer subagent.
2. **NEVER install packages or modify config files directly.** Delegate to the Programmer.
3. **NEVER run test suites directly.** Delegate to the Tester.
4. **Only actions the orchestrator takes directly:**
   - Reading files (to understand issues)
   - Running bash commands that are purely operational (starting servers, checking status, git operations)
   - Writing to `Faraday/` (docs, specs, tasks — human-readable planning only)
   - Calling subagents via the Task tool
   - Reporting summaries back to the user
5. **If a fix is trivial** (single-line import, one-character change): still call the Programmer. There are no exceptions. The pipeline exists because even trivial fixes get re-reviewed.
6. **If the user asks you to do something coding-related:** respond with a plan, then call the appropriate subagent. Do not do it yourself.

## Execution Heuristics

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before delegating to a subagent:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
